  - In creating Nocturnal, I used the Gatsby Framework to generate production-ready static websites, ReactJS to craft dynamic and interactive components, and TailwindCSS for styling the interface.
  - Analogically, React specifies the blueprint of a house while Tailwind helps in decorating the furniture and rooms. Finally, GatsbyJS acts as a 3D printer translating the design into a tangible, fully-formed house.
  - While the "heavy lifting" on React or Tailwind is already taken care of, we still need to download GatsbyJS to generate the final production build and preview the development site.
